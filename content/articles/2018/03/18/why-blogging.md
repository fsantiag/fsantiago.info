In the past few years, Iâ€™ve been trying to find some time to put my own website/blog online.
I believe this is a great way to share information and keep it organised and available to everyone. Besides, it is also a great way to improve your career by connecting to new people. Nevertheless, I never had enough time to organise the topics  that I consider interesting to share. I mean, blogging was never one of my first priorities but it was always there.

Well, I also consider that I am reaching a moment in my professional career that growing my network and sharing my learnings are essential to continue growing.

## What are the topics am I going to cover?
I decided to talk about three things that are part of my day to day: technology, living experiences and gaming:

* **Technology** is what I do for living and what I am passionate about. Therefore, most of the articles you will find here will be about that. By the way, when I say technology here I am referring to software development technologies, however I might write some articles about an awesome gadget that I just bought. ðŸ™‚
* **Living experiences** was the best combination of words that I could find to describe my different journeys around different countries in the world (If you have a better suggestion, please let me know!). I try to move to a different country every couple of years and I love that. I love languages, culture and I hope to share with you some of my impressions.
* **Gaming** is something that I started as a kid and it has been around for almost my whole life. I made great friends playing video games and I still dedicate some of my time to it. Although I still play video games, I donâ€™t play as much as I would like to. Thus, donâ€™t expect great gaming reviews because I do it more as hobby.
