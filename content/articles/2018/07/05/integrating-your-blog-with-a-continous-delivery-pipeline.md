I started this blog as Wordpress blog. By that time, I thought I could just use some of the features
that these blog engines provide so I would just focus on writing content. In the beginning that was
true, but I realised that Wordpress was "too heavy" for my purpose. I didn't want to take care of a
database, search for plugins or automate backups (although I liked the automation part of it ;)). That was when a friend at work reminded me that I
could use static content generators. I liked the idea. As an engineer, I could easily track everything using Git, no databases required,
and I could also apply continous deployment to make every commit go straight to my production server.
