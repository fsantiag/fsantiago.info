Well, when I first thought about writing something about the year in Singapore, I imagined talking how beatiful everything was, how the culture was so unique or how the food was so good and different. I could definitely talk about those things, a life changing experience for sure. However, I remembered that like many other places I've been, everything was very special not only because the place was amazing, but also because I was lucky to have amazing people with me. Therefore, this article is a way of saying thanks to everyone. Hope you enjoy the pics!
